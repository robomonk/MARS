# Jules VM Environment Setup Script (Conda Version)
#
# This script is designed to be run non-interactively within a secure,
# short-lived virtual machine (like the one used by Jules). It prepares
# the environment by creating a Conda environment from the project's
# 'environment.yml' file.
#
# It assumes:
# 1. It is being run from the root of the project repository.
# 2. The base VM image has a Conda installation somewhere on the filesystem.
# 3. The 'environment.yml' file exists in the repository root.
#

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
