# Jules VM Environment Setup Script (Conda Version)
#
# This script is designed to be fully self-contained for a non-interactive
# environment like Jules. It will:
# 1. Download and install Miniconda if the 'conda' command is not found.
# 2. Initialize the new Conda installation for the current shell.
# 3. Create the project-specific Conda environment from 'environment.yml'.
#
# It assumes:
# 1. It is being run from the root of the project repository.
# 2. The 'environment.yml' file exists in the repository root.
# 3. The VM has basic tools like 'wget' and 'bash'.
#

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
